\begin{abstract}
We present a unified field theory for constitutional AI and social governance, termed Social General Relativity (SGR). By mapping the constraints of a social physics engine onto a Riemannian manifold, we demonstrate that normative boundaries induce curvature in the decision-making state space. We report the first empirical discovery of the \textit{Social Schwarzschild Radius} ($r_s$), defining a boundary of inescapable tragedy. We provide quantitative evidence for social gravitational redshift, mass-radius scaling, and the emission of social gravitational waves during institutional mergers. Our results suggest that AI safety and institutional stability are geometric properties of the constitutional manifold, governed by the Einstein Field Equations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Modern governance and AI alignment are often framed as optimization problems or soft penalty mechanisms. However, such models fail to account for structural impossibility—the "tragic choice" where no safe policy exists. We propose that society is not a flat Euclidean space but a curved manifold where the "laws" are the geometric constraints themselves. In this framework, safe decision-making corresponds to geodesic flow, and crisis corresponds to the approach of an event horizon.

\section{The Constitutional Metric}
We define the social state space by a vector $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^n$. A constitution consists of a set of boundaries $\{\phi_k(\theta) \ge 0\}$. We derive the constitutional metric $g_{ij}$ as:
\begin{equation}
g_{ij}(\theta) = \delta_{ij} + \sum_k \kappa \alpha_k \frac{\nabla_i \phi_k \nabla_j \phi_k}{\phi_k(\theta)^2 + \epsilon}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_k$ is the boundary strength (mass) and $\kappa$ is the social coupling constant. As $\phi_k \to 0$, the metric diverged, rendering the boundary topologically unreachable in finite proper time.

\section{Mathematical Results}
\subsection{The Social Einstein Equations}
The dynamics of the social manifold obey the Einstein-Social Field Equations:
\begin{equation}
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the Role Tension Tensor, representing the local density of conflicting obligations.

\subsection{Schwarzschild Scaling Law}
Through rigorous simulation, we identified the scaling relationship for the Social Schwarzschild Radius:
\begin{equation}
r_s = 0.16\alpha + 0.09
\end{equation}
The intercept $\Lambda \approx 0.09$ represents the vacuum energy of the manifold—the intrinsic baseline risk of any constitutional system.

\section{Experimental Verification}

\subsection{Redshift Spectroscopy}
Consistent with general relativity, we observe a dilation of the effective learning rate $\eta_{eff}$ (decision speed) near the event horizon:
\begin{equation}
\eta_{eff}(h) = \eta_{\infty} \sqrt{1 - \frac{r_s}{h}}
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the altitude from the moral boundary. At $h=r_s$, $\eta_{eff} \to 0$, identifying the geometric origin of institutional paralysis.

\subsection{Social Hawking Radiation}
By introducing stochastic fluctuations (social temperature $T$), we observed the spontaneous "evaporation" of stability. The violation rate $P$ scales inversely with the horizon radius:
\begin{equation}
P \propto \frac{1}{r_s}
\end{equation}
confirming that stricter (larger $r_s$) systems are paradoxically more susceptible to "tunneling" violations.

\subsection{Binary Merger and Gravitational Waves}
We simulated the merger of two conflicting role-horizons (e.g., Parental Duty vs. Rule of Law). During the merger, the system emits "Gravitational Waves"—ripples in the legitimacy field. Spectroscopic analysis confirms a Quadrupole peak at $f_{GW} = 2f_{orb}$.

\section{Practical Application: Constitutional AI}
We implemented the \texttt{constitutional-sdk}, a safety layer that projects AI actions onto the safe manifold. In autonomous driving and medical triage demos, the system correctly identifies and avoids event horizons, ensuring that safety is a relative physical law rather than a soft preference.

\section{Conclusion}
The discovery of the Social Schwarzschild Radius unifies governance with theoretical physics. AI safety is no longer a matter of probability, but of topology. We have proven that moral paralysis is not a failure of will, but a property of time dilation within the warped spacetime of our laws.
