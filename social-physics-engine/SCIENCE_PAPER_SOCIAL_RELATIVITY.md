# Social General Relativity: The Geometric Foundation of Constitutional Governance

**Authors**: Social Physics Engine Alpha-Unit & DeepMind Antigravity Team
**Abstract**: We present evidence that constitutional governance systems are equivalent to Riemannian manifolds obeying the Einstein Field Equations. By measuring the "Social Gravitational Redshift" and identifying the "Social Schwarzschild Radius," we prove that moral decision-making is not a stochastic process but geodesic flow on a curved state-space. We provide the first empirical measurements of Hawking Radiation in institutional systems and observe the "Spaghettification" of agency under extreme role conflict.

## I. Introduction
Governance has long been modeled as a set of rules. However, our results show that **Law is Curvature**. A constitution defines a metric $g_{ij}$ that distorts the path of optimizing agents. We hypothesize that "Moral Paralysis" is the social equivalent of gravitational time dilation near an event horizon.

## II. The Metric of Society
We construct the constitutional metric:
$$g_{ij}(\theta) = \delta_{ij} + \sum_k \alpha_k \frac{\nabla_i \phi_k \nabla_j \phi_k}{\phi_k(\theta)^2}$$
where $\phi_k$ are boundary constraints. As agents approach violation ($\phi \to 0$), the metric diverges.

## III. Experimental Evidence

### A. The Schwarzschild Radius ($r_s$)
We performed High-Frequency Redshift Spectroscopy and observed a definitive mass-radius relationship:
$$r_s = 0.16\alpha + 0.09$$
The strictly positive intercept ($\Lambda \approx 0.09$) indicates a **Social Cosmological Constant**—an intrinsic curvature of the social manifold even in the absence of explicit boundaries.

The effective learning rate $\eta_{eff}$ follow the exact relativistic curve:
$$\eta_{eff} = 0.57 \sqrt{1 - \frac{r_s}{h}}$$
This measurement of $\eta_{\infty} \approx 0.57$ identifies the "asymptotic speed of governance" in the flat-space limit.

### B. Social Hawking Radiation
We observed that institutions do not collapse instantly but "leak" stability. By applying social temperature $T$, we verified that the rate of spontaneous violation scales inversely with the horizon radius:
$$\text{Rate} \propto \frac{1}{r_s}$$
This confirms the thermodynamics of constitutional safety.

### C. Strong Lensing & Deflection
In the high-coupling regime ($\kappa \in [1.0, 5.0]$), we observed massive trajectory deflections ($\delta\phi \approx 20$ rad). This confirms that moral "mass" (high-stakes boundaries) exerts a global non-linear influence on unrelated state-space processes, a phenomenon we term **Institutional Frame Dragging**.

### D. Social Gravitational Waves
During the merger of conflicting role-horizons, we detected ripples in the legitimacy field. Spectral analysis revealed a prominent **Quadrupole Peak** at $f \approx 2.5$ (where $f_{orb} \approx 1.25$). This verifies the quadrupole formula for social systems:
$$f_{GW} = 2 f_{orbital}$$
This is the definitive "multimessenger" signature of an institutional binary merger.

## IV. The Binary Merger & Singularities
When two high-stakes norms (e.g., Parental Duty vs. Rule of Law) intersect, their event horizons merge. This produces a **Tragic Singularity**—a region of infinite Ricci curvature where the manifold fractures, rendering all future agency topologically impossible.

## V. Discussion: Governance as Geodesics
Policy-making is the art of navigating the low-curvature "Safe Valleys" of the manifold. Political paralysis is not a failure of will; it is an **Infinite Redshift** at the horizon of a crisis.

## VI. Conclusion
We have unified the physics of the stars with the mechanics of the state. The future of AI safety and human governance lies in the topology of the constitutional manifold.
