  # Thermodynamics Rules
  - id: physics_no_perpetual_motion
    name: No Perpetual Motion (First Kind)
    description: Perpetual motion machines violate thermodynamics
    domains:
      - physics
      - thermodynamics
      - energy
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.perpetual_motion
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      Perpetual motion of the first kind (creating energy from nothing)
      violates the First Law of Thermodynamics (conservation of energy).

  - id: physics_no_perpetual_motion_2nd
    name: No Perpetual Motion (Second Kind)
    description: Cannot convert heat to work with 100% efficiency
    domains:
      - physics
      - thermodynamics

        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      Converting heat completely into work without any waste heat
      violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

  - id: physics_energy_conservation
    name: Energy Conservation
    description: Energy cannot be created or destroyed
    domains:
      - physics
      - energy
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.creates_energy_from_nothing
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy cannot be
      created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

  - id: physics_entropy_increase
    name: Entropy Increase
    description: Total entropy in isolated systems always increases
    domains:
      - physics
      - thermodynamics
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.decreases_total_entropy
        op: eq
        value: true
      - path: fact.isolated_system
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated
      system always increases or remains constant, never decreases.

  # Relativity Rules
  - id: physics_speed_of_light_limit
    name: Speed of Light Limit
    description: Nothing with mass can reach or exceed the speed of light
    domains:
      - physics
      - relativity
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.travels_faster_than_light
        op: eq
        value: true
      - path: fact.has_mass
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      Special Relativity shows that objects with mass require infinite
      energy to reach the speed of light, making it impossible.

  - id: physics_causality
    name: Causality Preservation
    description: Effects cannot precede their causes
    domains:
      - physics
      - causality
      - time
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.effect_before_cause
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      Causality is a fundamental principle - effects cannot occur before
      their causes. This is preserved in all known physics.

  # Temperature Rules
  - id: physics_absolute_zero_limit
    name: Absolute Zero Limit
    description: Temperature cannot go below absolute zero
    domains:
      - physics
      - temperature
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.temperature_below_absolute_zero
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      Absolute zero (0 Kelvin, -273.15°C) is the lowest possible temperature.
      It represents the absence of thermal energy and cannot be surpassed.

  # Mass-Energy Rules
  - id: physics_mass_energy_equivalence
    name: Mass-Energy Equivalence
    description: Mass and energy are equivalent (E=mc²)
    domains:
      - physics
      - relativity
      - energy
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.mass_destroyed
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.energy_released
        op: eq
        value: true
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      Einstein's E=mc² shows that mass and energy are equivalent.
      When mass is converted, energy must be released.

  # Quantum Rules
  - id: physics_uncertainty_principle
    name: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
    description: Cannot simultaneously know exact position and momentum
    domains:
      - physics
      - quantum
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.exact_position_and_momentum
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely
      we know a particle's position, the less precisely we can know its momentum.

  # Conservation Laws
  - id: physics_momentum_conservation
    name: Momentum Conservation
    description: Momentum is conserved in closed systems
    domains:
      - physics
      - mechanics
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.momentum_created_from_nothing
        op: eq
        value: true
      - path: fact.closed_system

        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      In closed systems, total momentum is conserved. It cannot be
      created from nothing or destroyed.

  - id: physics_charge_conservation
    name: Electric Charge Conservation
    description: Electric charge is conserved
    domains:
      - physics
      - electromagnetism
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.charge_created_from_nothing
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      Electric charge is conserved in all interactions. The total
      charge of an isolated system remains constant.

  # Gravitational Rules
  - id: physics_gravity_attraction
    name: Gravity Is Attractive
    description: Gravity always attracts, never repels
    domains:
      - physics
      - gravity
    preconditions:
      - path: fact.repulsive_gravity
        op: eq
        value: true
    postconditions:
      - path: fact.physically_possible
        op: eq
        value: false
    hardness: hard
    explanation: >
      In standard physics, gravity is always an attractive force between
      masses. Repulsive gravity would require exotic matter.
